# passwordmanager
This is a password manager that runs on python and saves the website, the username/email and the password to a csv file locally.
To use it, just copy and paste it into your preferred python ide (I made it in pycharm).
Note: Make sure you have the logo file and the main.py in the same folder/directory.
